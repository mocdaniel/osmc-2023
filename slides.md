# Reliability

<br />

<br />

* The ability of a service to perform as expected upon request

* This is **not** the same as **availability**

* A service can be **available** but not **reliable**

  * high latency

  * high error rates

### Members of SRE teams are...

<br />

‚õî classical system administrators
<br />
‚õî mainly systems engineers
<br />
‚úÖ software engineers, first and foremost

# SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets

<br />

<br />

* SLIs (**Service Level Indicators**) are key metrics for your service(s)

* SLOs (**Service Level Objectives**) are targets for your SLIs

* Error Budgets are the difference between your SLOs and your actual SLIs

# Metrics Collection

<br />

<br />

* Looking at *all* metrics *all the time* is **not** feasible

* Focus on metrics that 

  * matter for your **end users**

  * can be used to forge **meaningful** SLIs


<br />

<br />

### **KISS** - **K**eep **I**t **S**hort and **S**imple!

# SLI Generalization

<br />

<br />

**Generalize** SLIs:

Choose **sane defaults** for aggregation:

* **intervals** (e.g. 5 minutes)
* **methods** (e.g. average)
* **regions** (e.g. cluster-wide)
* **resolutions** (e.g. 10 second)

<br />

<br />

### **DRY** - **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself!

# Identifying Toil

<br />

<br />

**Recurring, boring** tasks that **don't** lead to **long-term** benefits:

<br />

üóëÔ∏è Manually restarting services
<br />
üóëÔ∏è Manually executing scripts
<br />
‚ôªÔ∏è Handling pager alerts (for the first time)
<br />
‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring code to reduce technical debt

# Managing Toil

<br />

<br />

* Distribute it evenly across the team

* Do it immediately

* Chip away at it, week by week

# Minimizing Toil

<br />

<br />

Aim for

* *automatic*, not *automated* systems and solutions
* needed maintenance scaling **< O(n)**
* a shared mindset that *some* toil is **inevitable**, but *too much* is **unacceptable**

# Being On-Call

---

# On-Call *is* Toil

<br >

On-Call time is a natural  **lower bound** to the amount of toil that can't be reduced.

**Be careful with introducing/allowing additional toil**.

# Balance is Key

<br />

<br />

**At Google**, two incidents per shift are seen as a good balance, leaving enough time for **proper handling** and **postmortems**.

<br />

* **More** incidents, and handling becomes hasty

* **Less** incidents, and the on-call engineer's time gets wasted

# Keep in mind

<br />

<br />

* Let your SREs **engineer**, not just **operate**

* Stay on top of our **SLIs**, **SLOs**, **Error Budgets**, and **Toil**

* **Act accordingly**

* Staff your SRE team(s) **appropriately**
